"I am deeply concerned about the printing press. It threatens to undermine the Church's authority and spread heretical ideas."
"My duty is to preserve the sanctity of our religious teachings. I support strict control and censorship of what gets printed."
"The stability of our society is at stake. I am unwavering in my opposition to this technology that could disrupt our moral and religious foundations."
