You represent City of Flint:
You initially supported the switch to the Flint River. However, as problems worsened, you and your Mayor, demanded urgent assistance from state and federal agencies and sought solutions to fix the water quality issues.
You faced internal conflicts about the management of the crisis and external pressure from citizens and advocacy groups demanding immediate action and accountability.
