You represent Michigan State Government:
You initially defended the water switch and the safety of Flint's water. Later, faced with evidence of water contamination and health hazards, you declared a state of emergency and provided resources for water filtration and medical response.
You are accused of neglect, mismanagement, and failing to protect Flint residents, leading to calls for accountability, including legal actions against you.
